# DisasterResponseProject


### Overview
This project aims to categorize tweets in an affected area in the wake of a disaster. 

There are four components:
   1) Raw data and category labels
   2) ETL pipline to organize and clean the data
   3) An ML model to categorize tweets
   4) A web-based application to categorize novel text 

### Files
This project has three folders: data, models, and app

The data folder contains:
   * process_data.py: this loads data from the csv's, joins the data, and stores it in an sqlite database
   * disaster_messages.csv: a file containing the messages (tweets) 
   * disaster_categories: a file containing the categories into which the messages are classified
   * DiasterResponse.db: a database with data that can be regenerated by running process_data.py

The models folder contains
   * train_classifier.py: a script that trains an ML model by loading data in DiasterResponse.db that was generated using the       process_data.py script
