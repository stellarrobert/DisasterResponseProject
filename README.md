# DisasterResponseProject

This project aims to categorize tweets in an affected area in the wake of a disaster. 

There are four components:
   1) Raw data and category labels
   2) ETL pipline to organize and clean the data
   3) An ML model to categorize tweets
   4) A web-based application to categorize novel text
